				<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #fff">Processing Audio Visualization (PAV)</span> is a music visualization project based on <a href="http://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> and <a href="http://www.java.com/" target="_blank">Java</a>. <br/>
				The project consists of three parts:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><span class="code">libpav</span> is a library for music visualization</li>
					<li><span class="code">pav</span> is an application that visualizes music from the network or a FIFO using <span class="code">libpav</span></li>
					<li><span class="code">pav-player</span> is a simple audio player with tag support that can stream audio data to <span class="code">pav</span> over the network</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>PAV can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/skpdvdd/PAV" target="_blank">github</a>. It is released under the GPL v3 license. If you use path for non-private purposes please contact me first.</p>			
				
				<h2>Using PAV</h2>
				
				<p>If you want to run PAV, first download the project from <a href="https://github.com/skpdvdd/PAV" target="_blank">github</a>. Then, navigate to <span class="code">/pav</span>, open a terminal and enter <span class="code">ant run-sw</span> or <span class="code">ant run-gl</span> (you must have <a href="http://ant.apache.org/" target="_blank">Ant</a> installed on your system for this to work). <span class="code">run-gl</span> will start PAV in OpenGL mode, utilizing the <a href="http://glgraphics.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">GLGraphics</a> library. This mode offers high quality and speed but might cause problems on some systems. <span class="code">run-sw</span> uses a software renderer. This should work on all systems, but quality and performance are much lower and some visualizations do not work with this mode. Further configuration can be done by editing the build file. For more information refer to  the <span class="code">readme.txt</span> file, which is included in the download.</p>
						
				<p>When you start the application a black window appears. In order to see something you first have to add a Visualizer. In PAV audio data is visualized by so called Visualizers. A visualization can consist of many independent Visualizers. In order to add a Visualizer to the stack, type <span class="code">add x</span> and hit enter, where <span class="code">x</span> is the name of a Visualizer. PAV currently supports 8 Visualizers (see <a href="visualizers.html">Visualizers</a>). You can add, configure, and remove these Visualizers at runtime by typing in the PAV window. All available commands are listed at the <a href="commands.html">commands</a> page.</p>

				<p>PAV receives data to visualize over the network or from a *nix FIFO. This abstracts from the way how music is accessed: Any program that implements the communication protocol of PAV can stream data to it (see <span class="code">readme.txt</span>).
				</p>
				<p>The project comes with a simple music player with PAV support. In order to start the player, navigate to <span class="code">/pav-player</span>, open a terminal and enter <span class="code">ant</span>. The player will stream music data to PAV via UDP as it is played and you should see a visualization of it in the PAV window.</p>

			<h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Using the code</h2>
			<span class="code">libpav</span> provides a framework that allows you to access audio data, transformations of that data, as well as common audio descriptors, and makes it easy to create new Visualizers. Please refer to the <a href="documentation/annotated.html" target="_blank">code documentation</a> for information on how to use the API. If you find bugs or want to contribute to the project, please contact me on github.
